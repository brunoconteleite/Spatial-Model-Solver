## Spatial Model Solver

This is a test for solving a system of non-linear equations for "my" spatial model of economy and geography. The model is based upon Allen, Arkolakis (2014). I start with a version of my model without agglomeration/congestion effects on amenity utility. This is a "economy on a line" version of the model!
